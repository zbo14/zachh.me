You only call
When you need help
And I pick you up
From somewhere else

And bring you back
You bring me down
So I bring it up
Just to make you yell

Hey hey don't turn away
You don't You don't know where to go
Well I'm already on my way
I don't give a fck what you think you know

I arrive
In the thick of it
And I realize
That my hide's too thin

It's light outside
I breath heavy on your line
You ask "what is wrong"
Please don't talk just spend my time

Does it have to be this way?
Maybe we can figure it out
Gimme a minute to change
Leave you staying the same

I can't go back
But my mind's stuck there
I look inside
To find I'm without

You're looking at me
I was looking to you
A few honest words
And a sigh that'll do

Time and time again
I let it pass me by
And when it starts to end
I will miss I don't know why
I will miss I don't know...
