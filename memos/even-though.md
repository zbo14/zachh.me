Even though
Things didn't play out
The way that I hoped
Ohhh

I wouldn't change
Anything in the slightest way
I know it sounds strange

Whatever your reason
The one you say
Or the one you're thinking
I don't need an explanation

Part of me
Would like to know
But what would that be
Another truth that's hard to swallow?

The moment cut so deep
The sun kissed your hair
And you burned right through me

The memory stings so sweet
Now that I know
What I refused to believe
