We're past halfway
I'll keep going
I really don't mind walking
I really don't mind walking

'Specially if it means
We get another 15 minutes of talking
I can't help but note
Every anecdote...
That strays from the topic
Sorta related so that's why I thought it
It might make a nice little detour, before
We get where we're going
Why don't we lose a little focus?

I really don't mind strolling
I really don't mind strolling
I wish that time would slow and
We could say everything unspoken

Text me when you get back
So i know that you're ok
How could i fall asleep after that
There's no way
I play it again and again in my head til-
Til I'm spent

What little is left
Tells me not to get
Too far ahead
I pick up that pen
And write you a letter
On a page with frayed edges
I could just call you up
I want to drop this off

I really don't mind walking
Really don't mind
'Cause when it's you on the other end
The trip's worth more than every step

I really don't mind walking
You make me wanna go walking
