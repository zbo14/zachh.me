Let me say the same
In a slightly different way
Worn-down wardrobes on the sidewalk
Sun-soaked windows, turn the light off

I didn't know it was there
Til it was everywhere
I won't let it get to me
I've got my sights set clearly

You're gonna miss your flight
Either way you're flying
Slice my feet on the rocks
You get a scratch but not that much

My cut looks worse than it stings
But you know I'm lying
I won't let it get to me
I've got my sights set clearly

Patches of fabric strewn 'round the room
Patterns I've seen still seem new
Keep on saying we'll piece it together
Still splitting our plates tastes better

What ifs turn into "as you wish"
Guess I can do this
I'll let it, just a little bit
